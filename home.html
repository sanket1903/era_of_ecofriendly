      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The idea of green energy is introduced in November 2006 as renewable energy standard offer program. That offer was in short called as SOP or RESOP. It introduced a 20 year feed in tariffs for hydro, wind, solar (PV) and biomass projects. The Ontario Green Energy Act (GEA), officially the Green Energy and Green Economy Act 2009 was introduced in the Ontario Legislature on February 23, 2009, to expand renewable energy production and encourage energy conservation[1]. The word ‘Green’ make our mind to think about a world without pollution and eco friendly. So the green energy reflects the idea about generation of energy from natural resources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, plant, algae, geothermal heat, etc. having no or less impact on the environment and can be renewed. These energy resources are renewable, meaning they're naturally replenished. <br><br> There are two types of sources of energy in the world: renewable energy sources and non-renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources are generated directly from nature for example, from the sun, rain, wind, tides, and it is possible to generate it over and over whenever it is needed. Renewable energy sources are abundant and are definitely the cleanest energy sources in Earth. Many types of Renewable energy sources are solar energy, biomass energy, wind energy, tidal energy, hydro energy, and geothermal energy. For instance, it is possible to use the energy from the sun and that is converted into electricity. Geothermal, wind, tides, and biomass energy from plants can also be used in different forms like Wind is harnessed from Earth's natural weather patterns. Hydropower comes from flowing rivers and from reservoirs. Solar energy comes from the Sun's light and radiation. Geothermal energy comes from the heat produced by the Earth underneath the ground. The advantages of Renewable energy is that wind, sun, ocean, and geothermal energy is in abundance and completely free of charge. The renewable energy sources have very low or zero carbon emissions, so they are environmental friendly. The another advantage is, it is not necessary to rely on any country to supply renewable energy sources, unlike its non-renewable counterparts. <br><br> As temperatures rise, agricultural output will fall, damage from floods and storms will increase, (tropical) diseases will become more prevalent and access to water will become more of a problem for more and more people. The cost to our environment is greater and loss is irreversible. The Earth’s flora and fauna will suffer both directly from higher temperatures and indirectly through the damage to their habitats. Ecosystems will disappear. Even small temperature increases will cause coral bleaching and threaten some amphibians. Temperature rises of 3° or 4°C and more will lead to major extinctions around the globe.</h5>
